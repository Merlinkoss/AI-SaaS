Welcome to our fancy README.md! Here, we proudly present the list of amazing technologies we have utilized in our project. Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in making our project a success. Let's briefly introduce each of them:

### Next.js

Next.js is a powerful and popular React framework that enables us to build fast and scalable web applications. It offers server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and excellent developer experience.

### Axios

Axios is a widely used JavaScript library that simplifies making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It provides a clean API, supports various request methods, and handles responses efficiently.

### Clerk

Clerk is a cutting-edge authentication and user management system that simplifies the process of adding user accounts, sign-ins, and sign-ups to our application.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps us create beautiful and responsive user interfaces with minimal effort. It provides a wide range of pre-built styles and allows for easy customization.

### Shadcn

Shadcn is a mysterious and fascinating technology that adds a touch of magic to our project. We'll let you discover its secrets when you explore our application!

### OpenAI

OpenAI is a groundbreaking AI research organization that has made significant contributions to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Our project may leverage some of OpenAI's technologies to enhance certain features.

### ReplicateAI

ReplicateAI, another remarkable AI-related technology, could be used in our project to replicate and reproduce research experiments, pushing the boundaries of innovation.

### Prisma

Prisma is an impressive ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and management. It enables us to interact with our database using a type-safe and intuitive API.

### Vercel

Vercel is a reliable and efficient platform for deploying web applications. It offers easy deployment workflows and excellent performance, ensuring our project is available to users worldwide.

### Zustand

Zustand is a state management library for React applications that provides a simple and flexible way to manage state. It helps us keep our application's state in sync and easily accessible across components.

### O2Pay

Global, secure and irreversible crypto payment gateway

### Typewriter Effect

The Typewriter Effect is a delightful text animation that simulates the look of typing text on a typewriter. We've used this effect to add a touch of elegance to certain sections of our application.

### Docker

Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. It handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code.
